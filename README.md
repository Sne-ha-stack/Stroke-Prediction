# Rapid Stroke Detection Through Facial Expression Analysis 

# Introduction

Stroke remains a major public health concern in India, being the fourth leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability. 
Early detection of stroke symptoms such as **drooping facial muscles**, **asymmetric smiles**, and **speech problems** is critical for timely medical intervention.
The project focuses on developing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that analyzes facial expressions to rapidly identify stroke symptoms.

# Dataset
